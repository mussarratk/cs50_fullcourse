Here are the additional features and their explanations:

1. Memory Overhead: Indicates the typical memory usage overhead of each data structure. Lists have higher overhead due to dynamic resizing when elements are added, while tuples have lower overhead because of their fixed size and immutability.
2. Membership Testing: How fast membership testing (using the `in` operator) is for each data structure. Sets and dictionaries have faster membership testing compared to lists and tuples.
3. Iteration: How fast the data structure can be iterated over to access its elements. Lists, tuples, and sets offer fast iteration, while dictionaries can also be iterated efficiently using keys, values, or items methods.

Keep in mind that the performance characteristics mentioned above may vary depending on the size of the data structures and the specific operations being performed. In Python, each data structure has its strengths and best use cases, so it's essential to choose the appropriate one based on the requirements of your program.
