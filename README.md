Here are the additional features and their explanations:

1. Memory Overhead: Indicates the typical memory usage overhead of each data structure. Lists have higher overhead due to dynamic resizing when elements are added, while tuples have lower overhead because of their fixed size and immutability.
2. Membership Testing: How fast membership testing (using the `in` operator) is for each data structure. Sets and dictionaries have faster membership testing compared to lists and tuples.
3. Iteration: How fast the data structure can be iterated over to access its elements. Lists, tuples, and sets offer fast iteration, while dictionaries can also be iterated efficiently using keys, values, or items methods.

Keep in mind that the performance characteristics mentioned above may vary depending on the size of the data structures and the specific operations being performed. In Python, each data structure has its strengths and best use cases, so it's essential to choose the appropriate one based on the requirements of your program.

Sure, let's add some more common methods to the table and include columns for loop function and examples:

Here are the additional columns and their explanations:

1. Loop Function: Shows the loop function used to iterate over elements in the data structure. For lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets, we use a `for` loop, while for list comprehension, we don't need a loop function.
2. Example: Provides an example of how to use the loop function to iterate over elements in the data structure.

With the loop function and examples added, the table now provides a more comprehensive overview of the various data structures in Python, their properties, common functions/methods, and how to perform iteration on each of them.
